      "Today was the first day after I posted a tour in advance on PolyLearn and announced it was available for students to work on before class.  I noticed that many people came to class and immediately started working on exercises, so I assumed that meant they had already completed the tour.  However, after about a half an hour of answering trivial questions, I stopped the class and we had a pep talk.  I reminded them that the tours are not something to \"get through\" quickly.  They need to be done slowly, carefully, thoughtfully, so they get the training they need to do the exercises.  I told them that many of their questions were easily answered in the tour and I started referring them to it for guidance.  "
