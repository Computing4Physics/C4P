      "**4.** I initiated a verbal discussion of Program Design strategies with the remaining class period, but next time I will probably prepare a document with guidance to distribute on PolyLearn for their reference.  One could present an entire course on program design, so I stuck to some general advice:\n",
      "   * **Design** - Identify the problem that you need to solve and/or questions that you need to answer, then create a list of steps for how to get to the solution/answer.\n",
      "   * **Modularization** - break a complex problem into easy-to-implement building blocks that can be independently tested.\n",
      "   * **Scaffolding** - like an outline of a software program in which skeletons of the main functions for the program are developed that take in the necessary inputs and just pass default information back until you are ready to implement the \"guts\"\n",
      "   * **Documentation** - comment your code as you go, include docstrings in all major functions\n",
      "   * **Testing** - include test cases for each function that demonstrate they work as expected.\n",
      "   * **Debugging** - where the bulk of the work takes place.\n",
