      "In 1971, the American economist Thomas Schelling created an agent-based model that might help explain why segregation is so difficult to combat. His model of segregation showed that even when individuals (or \"agents\") didn't mind being surrounded or living by agents of a different race, they would still choose to segregate themselves from other agents over time. Although the model is quite simple, it gives a fascinating look at how individuals might self-segregate, even when they have no explicit desire to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model was formulated in a social science context, but it has direct analogues to physical systems, such as in the mixing of liquids in an emulsion and the self-assembly of crystalline structures on metal surfaces.  Emulsions are immiscible (incapable of mixing) colloidal suspensions of one liquid in another liquid. Emulsions will separate into their individual components if allowed to sit for long enough. Some examples of emulsions include: face creams, soapy water and salad dressings made by shaken oil and vinegar."

      "Here is a simple variation on Schelling's model. Suppose there are two types of agents: X and O. The two types of agents might represent oil and water droplets in a colloidal suspension.  Two populations of the two agent types are initially placed into random locations of a neighborhood represented by a grid. After placing all the agents in the grid, each cell is either occupied by an agent or is empty as shown below. \n",

      "Now we must determine if each agent is satisfied with its current location. A satisfied agent is one that is surrounded by at least $t$ percent of agents that are like itself. This threshold $t$ is one that will apply to all agents in the model, even though in the social science example, the \"agents\" might each have a different threshold they are satisfied with. Note that the higher the threshold, the higher the likelihood the agents will not be satisfied with their current location.\n",

If fewer than 30% are X, then the agent is not satisfied, and it will want to change its location in the grid. For the remainder of this explanation, let's assume a threshold $t$ of 30%. This means every agent is fine with being in the minority as long as there are at least 30% of similar agents in adjacent cells."
