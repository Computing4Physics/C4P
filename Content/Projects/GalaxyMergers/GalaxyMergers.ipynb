      "One of the fundamental questions in astrophysics is how galaxies form, evolve and interact.  It might seem surprising that galaxies separated by vast distances could interact with one another, but their immense masses and the gravitational forces that govern their formation and evolution nevertheless can lead to violent interactions.  The Milky Way galaxy is right now on a collision course with the Andromeda galaxy and they are predicted to collide in about 4 billion years.  Even though both galaxies are made up of hundreds of billions of stars, the separation between stars in the galaxies means that the chances of direct stellar collisions are extremely small.  Nevertheless, if our descendents are still around to experience it, the view of our night sky will definitely change as a result of this interaction."

The video above was probably generated on massive supercomputers running full blast for a very long time to generate the paths of all of the individual stars as the galaxies merged.  Is it really possible that we could generate something like that using a laptop and the basic programming skills from PHYS 202?  The answer is yes, if we make some simplifying assumptions.  \n",

Their work was an extension of a previous paper published in German in 1963 describing the system of equations and an early attempt to investigate how the spiral structure of galaxies emerges."
