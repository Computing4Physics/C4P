In this lesson we will explore an entirely different technique, one that is very useful because it easily extends to intgrating functions in any number of dimensions.  There are many areas of physics where we need to evaluate multi-dimensional integrals.  For example, to find the electric field due to a surface or volume of charge.\n",

      "Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms that use random number sampling to obtain numerical results.  They were pioneered by scientists working on the Manhattan Project to simulate the interactions of neutrons with matter during the development of the first atomic weapons.  \"Monte Carlo\" was the code name used to disguise the work of Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann as they developed the first algorithms using random number sampling.  The choice of that particular codename comes from the fact that the technique resembles the games of chance played in the casinos of Monte Carlo in the principality of Monaco. (Las Vegas was not yet as well known as a center of gambling.)  \n",
