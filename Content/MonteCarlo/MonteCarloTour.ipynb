      "We've seen how to produce statistically random numbers distributed uniformly over some interval, but what if we wanted to increase the number of samples in a particular region of $x$?  What if we wanted the probability to be distributed according to some function, $f(x)$?  The probability of getting a particular value $x_i$ should depend on the value of $f(x_i)$.  We have two primary ways to go about this:\n",

      "Rejection Sampling is similar to what we did when we learned about \"Hit or Miss\" Monte Carlo integration.  As a reminder, the crux of it for one-dimensional functions is that we (1) generated a pair of random numbers $(x_i,y_i)$ within a box around our function, $f(x)$, then (2) checked to see whether the value of $y_i$ was greater than or less than the value $f(x_i)$.  If $y_i$ was less than $f(x_i)$ we kept the values $(x_i,y_i)$ and if $y_i$ was greater than $f(x_i)$ we threw them out.  Over many iterations, $N$, we \"filled in\" the area defined by the function, which allowed us to compute the integral numerically by multiplying the area of the box times the ratio of the number of hits to (hits+misses).\n",

Here is a histogram of the number of times a particular value of $x_i$ was selected (\"hits\") using rejection sampling for the function in the previous figure, normalized and plotted with the original function.\n",

      "We could apply this method with any function to be able to sample randomly from it, but there are some drawbacks.  This is a somewhat inefficient method, since we must generate *two* random numbers for every possible sample point *and* we reject many of the samples.  In this example, a large fraction of the area of the box lies above the function boundary.  There are ways to redefine the shape of the box to better match the shape of the function, but these methods can get complicated.\n",

      "John von Neumann (1903-1957), the eminent mathematician, devised an efficient and elegant method to circumvent the rejections. This consists of formulating the cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F(x)$ for our function $f(x)$, inverting the CDF to get $F^{-1} = x(F)$, sampling numbers $z$ from the uniform distribution U[0,1] and using the inverse to find $x=F^{-1}(z)$.  That's a mouthful.  Let's break it down."

      "If you look at the help for the `numpy.random` module, you will see that there is a set of standard built-in distributions that you can sample from.  These use methods such as the Inverse CDF Transform with exact solutions where possible, and other more advanced techniques when necessary, to produce statistically safe samples.  Whenever you can, use the built-in functions.  When a particular function is not available, you can use this technique.  The numerical method can also be adapted to more than one-dimension, or rejection sampling can be used in those cases."

      "There are many areas of physics where it is useful to simulate a phenomenon before we conduct an experiment, to help guide the experimental design and procedure.  There are also cases where we use simulations of an experiment after the fact to correct for any instrumental biases.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in high energy particle and nuclear collisions, we need to know how well our detectors \"see\" the particles produced in the collisions so we can optimize their design to catch as many as possible.  We can use Monte Carlo sampling to simulate the stochastic nature of the interaction of particles with matter to model the \"response\" of our detector to particles of a known type and energy.  The input to the simulation represents the \"true\" distribution of particles, while the output corresponds to an estimate of the \"observed\" distribution of particles, assuming that we have accurately characterized the physics of the interactions in our simulation.  The ratio of input to output can be used as a correction factor to estimate the \"true\" distribution of particles from the \"observed\" distribution in a real experiment.  Obviously, reliable simulations are essential to producing good results.\n",

      "The [GEANT4](http://www.geant4.org/geant4/) package, written in C++, and its Fortran 77 precursor GEANT3, are toolkits for simulating the passage of particles through matter.  The simulations use Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the inherently stochastic processes that govern particle interactions.  All of the LHC experiments and many other high energy particle and nuclear physics experiments rely on it.  The physics in the package has been tested repeatedly against benchmark experimental data to validate its output.  It is a complex program that can be daunting when you first start using it, so many concrete examples are provided with the software to show how it can be used in different contexts.  Assessing radiation damage and the interaction of particle beams with human tissue for medical applications are two notable examples.  \n",

      "Don't worry, we won't be learning GEANT4 in this class, but I present it as a classic example of a Monte Carlo sampling simulator that is in common use.  For our purposes, a simple example from your introductory Modern Physics course will be more instructive."
