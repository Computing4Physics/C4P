      "There are many different ways to generate uniform random numbers over a specified range (such as U[0,1]).  Physically, we can spin a roulette wheel, draw balls from a lottery, throw darts at a board, etc.  However, when we wish to use the numbers in a computer, obviously we need a way to generate the numbers algorithmically.  Numerically/arithmetically, we can use a sequential method where each new number is a deterministic function of the previous numbers.  This destroys their true randomness and makes them at best, \"pseudo-random\".  However, in most cases, it is sufficient if the numbers \u201clook\u201d uniformly distributed and have no correlation between them. i.e. they pass statistical tests and obey the central limit theorem.\n",

      "1. be fast and not memory intensive\n",

      "2. be able to reproduce a given stream of random numbers (for debugging/verification of computer programs or so we can use *identical* numbers to compare different systems)\n",

      "3. be able to produce several different independent \u201cstreams\u201d of random numbers\n",
      "\n",
      "4. have a long periodicity, so that they do not wrap around and produce the same numbers again within a reasonably long window.\n",
      "\n",
      "To obtain a sequence of pseudo-random numbers, one initilizes the state of the generator with a truly random \"seed\" value and the generator uses that seed to create an initial \"state\", then produces a pseudo-random sequence of numbers from that state.  The sequence will eventually repeat when the generator's state returns to that initial one.  The length of the sequence of non-repeating numbers is the *period* of the PRNG.  A more technical definition from wikipedia states: \"The period of a PRNG is defined as the maximum over all starting states of the length of the repetition-free prefix of the sequence. The period is bounded by the size of the seed state, measured in bits.\" If a PRNG's internal state contains $n$ bits, its period can be no longer than 2$^n$ results, and may be much shorter.  It is relatively easy to build PRNGs with periods long enough for many practical applications, but one must be cautious in applying PRNG's to problems that require very large quantities of random numbers.\n",

      "Almost all languages and simulation packages have good built-in generators.  We won't dwell on the details of how they work, but let us assume that we have an algorithm (program) that generates independent samples of uniform[0,1] random variables.  In Python, we can use the NumPy random library, which is based on the Mersenne-Twister algorithm developed in 1997."
